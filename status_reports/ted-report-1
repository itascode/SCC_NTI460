Student Name: Ted Jensen
Status Report #1
Date: 4/22/2018

What have you completed since the last report?
I have managed to get into the target switch. May or may not still be relevant by next report.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?
If the project objectives are still the same as they are currently, then I will hope to have all of the necessary Cisco scripting and implementation done.

What is getting in your way?
Currently, all of the public-facing interfaces on the switch are flapping wildly. The switch cannot access the outside internet. At first, I thought it was an etherchannel issue, but trunking and port-channeling did not fix it. 
Should everything be the same for next session, I will investigate possible STP failure causes.
