Status Report # 6

What have you completed since the last report?

I've been working on the Cisco multilayer switch and helping my teammates with the Xen
Server installs today. I got SSH access setup on the switch which eases the access of the switch.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I will have written the script I used to connect via SSH to the switch, and also will
have learned about Ansible PlayBooks and gotten some experience with them.

What is getting in your way?

Time management is an issue as we need to be able to find when everyone is able to meet;
now we're able to meet on Saturdays though, so I guess the next biggest thing would be
setting and reaching milestones and really just optimizing our time spent collaborating
(e.g. automating).
