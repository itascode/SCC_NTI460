Status Report # 19
Date: 05-23-18

What have you completed since the last report?

Phew, another day down and another progress report. Honestly I haven't completed
much since the last status report; right now I'm working at getting caught up in
everything since we're gone on vacation over the past week or so. What I did do is
help oversee the process of getting OpenStack installed on our hardware. I had to
leave early unfortunately since I had a class at 6:00 pm, but what I saw looked like
some minor issues which need to be resolved if the install is going to be successful.


What do you plan to complete by the next report?

The next step is ensuring that things get resolved and we're able to continue moving
forward with our on-premises portion of the Practicum. I believe that it's also important
that I spend the time being able to get a good start on the cloud portion of this
Practicum. The next things that I hope to be able to contribute to will be writing some
Ansible code as well as planning out our next steps for the rest of the on-prem
Practicum with the rest of the team.


What is getting in your way?

What I've learned is that there are certain days where I'm able to be more
productive than others. This is due to the work schedule that I've been using
this quarter and didn't previously think about. The days seem to have gone by
without me being able to contribute as much as I'd hoped; where I thought that
I'd be able to get my Linux homework done easily and also work on the Practicum,
it didn't actually turn out that way. What actually ended up happening is that
I got stuck in the process of automating the Django/Postgres install that we're
doing and of course it was something small in software which I'd previously
overlooked but ended up preventing me from being able to get my work done.
