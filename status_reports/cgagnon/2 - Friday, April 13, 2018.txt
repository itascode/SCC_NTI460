Status Report # 2

What have you completed since the last report?

I've researched and read about YAML Ain't Markup Language. I am excited to start using this data-serialization
language as it seems like it offers a lot more features than just plain JSON. I also got a kick out of
the website http://yaml.org/

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I plan to dig into Ansible and start learning about playbooks. I'd like to
complete the Ansible tutorial link that was sent in our Slack Team but we'll see how far I get.
I can/will also setup Trello + Slack integration after everyone is ready to go.

What is getting in your way?

I am looking forward to the walk-through and am hoping that we'll be able to find a time to meet in the
future which works for everyone. I end up working most hours on the weekdays and so it'll be awesome
if we'll be able to meet on Saturdays.
