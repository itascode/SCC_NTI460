Status Report # 7
Date: 04-25-18

What have you completed since the last report?

I have labeled the machines and setup our Trello team so that we're able to communicate
more efficiently and effectively. The Trello will be especially useful as it allows
us to gain insight into change management and gives everyone an easy way to see
the work that has been done and will be done; all of this can be completed in Trello
or even through our Slack team.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I'll have looked into the utility of our Trello and applied some aspect
of it to our Practicum (probably generating tasks). I am also planning on learning
more about Ansible and posting in the discussion, but I am not sure if that'll get
done by the next status report.

What is getting in your way?

Being able to understand when changes are being applied to our infrastructure is
definitely a challenge that needs to be addressed; I'm seeing changes happening
without any communication on our Slack prior to their implementation; I am hoping
that we'll be able to guide ourselves through via using our tools to do so.
