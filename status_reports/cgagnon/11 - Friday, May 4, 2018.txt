What have you completed since the last report?

Since the last report I've been able to learn some things about Ansible and
discuss possible change management policies with some of our group members. A
decision ended up being made which is halting all changes on the project until
we meet as a group.


What do you plan to complete by the next report?

During our next meeting I am confident that we'll be able to be successful
with any new policies which are implemented and I'm hoping that getting together
and just talking about the Practicum and who will be delegated to do what when
ends up being the key to us being more productive as a team.

What is getting in your way?

I believe that learning more about Ansible and carving out time to do that
would be my current limiter. I would like to get the discussion done but also show
that I understand enough about Ansible to be able to do useful things with it.
