What have you completed since the last report?

This is my first report. Yesterday we went over the general class procedures and
learned about what we'd be doing for the Practicum. So far I've completed a refactoring
of the notes for this meeting. This helped me review what we discussed during the meeting.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I plan to take a look at yaml and if I find time also look at
the Ansible tutorials.

What is getting in your way?

I don't think anything will get in my way since this is just a learning thing.
Maybe it'll take me a long time to learn, but that's ok too :)
