What have you completed since the last report?

Since the last report we've been able to update our Trello tasks and review the tasks
which we'll be completing next. We're able to meet with Michael in order to further
understand how we'll be completing our Practicum.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By Friday we plan to have more work done on our cloud proposal, and I plan to have
submitted some information about Ansible to the discussion. We're planning on meeting
 Saturday, where I want to go over our change management policy with the group. We
 will need to paste our history files when we submit changes and if possible
 elaborate on that file with what the commands actually do mapped to what's
 actually been done. It's been a fun ride learning about what we'll be able to do
 next and seeing just how far we've come in the short period of a couple of weeks.
 I'm excited.


What is getting in your way?

Change management ended up being a major time-suck over the week. I had talked with some
group members who said that servers were burned down and reimaged without the people doing
that change communicating it to the group. I feel like that's a major no-no and something that
we need to address as a team. It caused issues when another group member attempted to log back in
to the iSCSI controller and couldn't because the password which was set apparently wasn't working anymore.
