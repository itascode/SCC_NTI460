Status Report # 5
Date: 04-20-18

What have you completed since the last report?

Since the last report I've taken a quick-look at Jonathan's proposal
in addition to reviewing Slacks messages and relaying information from David about
Open Stack.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report we'll have had our first session of working as a team and
looking at some of the hardware/software configurations in regard to our Practicum.
I will have a better understanding of how we'll do what we intend to do and what needs
to be done next.

What is getting in your way?

Time management wasn't as easy this past week and I had to put more time into something
classes and pull back on my work more than I'd expected to. I also had a big project
that I've been working on for some months and will be presenting tomorrow; I am
planning on catching up more over the weekend and I'm excited to get to work more on
the Practicum.
