Status Report # 8

What have you completed since the last report?

I've looked into Trello and the assignments which we're graded with its use via Canvas.
 Since Wednesday I haven't made as much progress as I would've liked to have made. I got
stuck on some code I was writing for my Linux class and as a result was unable to spend
as much time as I wanted to on the Practicum. 

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

Our next report will be after our Saturday meeting! There'll be a lot going on, mainly with
an installation of Open Stack in addition to Ansible and potentially some networking.
I am hoping to be able to bring our Change Management process to the forefront so that
we're able to better understand what changes are to be made and what's already been changed.

What is getting in your way?

This time around it's time management; I have ADHD and I tend to get sucked inside of
tasks without realizing how long I'm really spending on them. This is great in some ways
because I get to learn a lot of interesting and useful things, but not so great when
it stretches me thin and I'm unable to complete other tasks. I am hoping that I can corral
the cats in my brain so that I'm able to better work with my disability.
