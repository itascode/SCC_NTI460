Student Name: Cody Antonio Gagnon
Status Report # 4
Date: 04-18-18

What have you completed since the last report?

Today I did a couple things to wrap my head around this project.
Fadil and I went to the server room to check the configuration, and I also
learned about how some of the networking could be implemented. What I learned is that I don't know
how the actual installation of an OS works on a blade server yet, and I find this
fascinating. I "burned" an image with CentOS on it to prepare for installation,
just in case I get the chance to participate at that point.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I hope to have seen and reviewed the proposal for our statement
of work. I also will be looking at Ansible at the latest this weekend and finally
writing some playbooks and other code for this class.

What is getting in your way?

I'd like to be able to automate the process of installing OpenStack and XenServer
on all of the compute nodes by getting everyone to participate in writing a big script;
I have no idea how to coordinate this type of effort. Also time management is rearing its
head and I will need to ensure that I'm able to contribute whenever possible.
