Student Name: Cody Antonio Gagnon
Status Report # 20
Date: 05-25-18

What have you completed since the last report?

Today I installed Ansible on my MacOS and started learning more about how to write
scripts for it. I am excited because I may have the opportunity to not only deploy
Ansible for this Practicum, but also potentially for the MakerSpace which I volunteer
at.


What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I am hoping to be able to write some code soon to be more productive with Ansible.
My biggest wish would be having the ability to spin up an instance on Google Cloud
by the end of the weekend.

What is getting in your way?

I didn't make as much progress as I would have hoped, but since it's Memorial Day
Weekend, I'm hoping to be able to recoup my lost time over the past week and work
with the team for the on-premise project in addition to the cloud project. Mainly,
it's still time management which is getting in my way. I believe I'll get more done
when I'm able to; going on vacation has kinda thrown me all out of whack and I'm just
now getting back to the schedule I had before.
