What have you completed since the last report?

Since our last report I've created specifications of scope for what each team
member will be responsible for completing in the span of the presentation. After
we met on Saturday, I also feel like we got a much better footing on what some of
the potential sore spots or trouble points would be throughout the rest of our
Practicum using Ansible. With those resolved I feel like we have a higher chance
to succeed with our individual components and to provide a great presentation.


What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I'd like to start working more on the presentation and figuring out the input/output
of variables from one playbook to another. I'd also like to get an update about
where we're at with the on-prem part of the project and see if/how I'm able to
contribute to that aspect of the Practicum.

What is getting in your way?

Right now, it's gotta be my other Linux classes, which really just boils down to
the time I currently have to dedicate to the Practicum. Luckily I spent a decent
amount of time setting things up for this part of the project, so I think we'll
be good in getting it done on time; but this week I don't see myself getting too
much done until Thursday. Then I want to get a lot done ✔️
