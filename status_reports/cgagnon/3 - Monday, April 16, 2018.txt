What have you completed since the last report?

Since the last report we've completed our walkthrough meeting.
This meeting is important because it allows us to further understand what we'll
be doing throughout the next two months of this course. I have written notes and
am using them to guide myself through the different components of our practicum.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

By the next report I will have learned more about Ansible and/or reviewed the
rough draft of our proposal.

What is getting in your way?

I would also like to be able to better interpret the specifics of what we'll
actually be implementing. More bluntly, being able to understand how the
processes work together is currently getting in my way. I'd like to understand
them further at the specific configuration level.
