What have you completed since the last report?

I spent time learning about Ansible today as well as throwing together a mini-guide
which will help me and my classmates/other when we want to use GCP to deploy
instances from Ansible or another configuration management tool to cloud platforms.
I was actually surprised by how easy it was to set everything up, and my mind is
filling up with ideas about what I might want to be able to implement with Ansible.


What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I may step out of my comfort zone or not with this part of the project; I could
easily adapt my Linux code for this class, or I could go all out and do something
that would be really fun to work on but might end up taking too much time if I'm
not careful when scoping it out. I am hoping by the next report I have these ideas
solidified so I'm able to create some goals and get more done sooner!

What is getting in your way?

A weird one, but being able to hit a wall before I see you tomorrow so that I'm able
to get more out of our meeting üòÅ. I'm hoping that I'll be able to find some issues
with my use of Ansible that I will need assistance or knowledge of to be able to
get things working by then or it might be a thing that takes longer than it needs to.
Or maybe it'll be getting that idea which will be a complete monster of a challenge,
which will prevent me from getting things done? At any rate, getting things done
faster would be a plus so that I'm more comfortable with this part of the Practicum.
It would definitely be a plus.
