What have you completed since the last report?

I have finalized the SCC_DevOps_Proposal for submission with my teammates edits and addons. I attended the team session on Saturday and worked with everyone to attempt to install software. Ultimately, we were not able to, but we did develop an alternative game plan with different hardware and made a plan to meet again.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I hope to have a workable script for automating the install of openstack with ansible. I will also attend a team meeting on Tuesday evening since I could not be there Monday evening. I will continue working with the team to get our infrastructure up and running.

What is getting in your way?

Finding time to be on campus to work on the hardware. Finding out the hardware does not support our software. A lot of the software is new to me. I feel like a crash course would go a long way in helping me to understand it more and make sure I am moving in the right direction to make my contributions to the project functional.
