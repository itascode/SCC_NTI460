What have you completed since the last report?

Met with the class on Saturday to work on the hardware. Specifically, networking and start testing parts of the Ansible-OpenStack deployment. Research on deploying the ssh keys for Ansible via script and still maintaining access for outside ssh.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I plan to have the ssh keys figured out and networking configured in the script/playbooks. Meet with team Tuesday afternoon.

What is getting in your way?

I am not able to meet in the mornings and I feel like I am missing a lot of what is going on and important configuration steps. The documentation by the team is great, but I still have questions and need some face-to-face chats.
