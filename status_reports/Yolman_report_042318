What have you completed since the last report?

We finally could have some installation on the servers.
due to the incompatibility of software on the blade centers
we had to move the whole project into individual boxes that 
we will interconnect. Today, I installed Xen and CentOS and configure the
access of the switch


What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I expect that my team and I will have been installed the software on each 
server and configure them. also, I hope to start working on the LAN connectivity

What is getting in your way?

The disponibility of the team will be an small inconvenience
