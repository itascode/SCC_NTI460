Status Report #6
Date:04/27/2018

What have you completed since the last report?

my team and I created the windows VM that holds the xen-center. I also opened
the SSH communication with all devices into the lisanet network, so that any person on the team
can connect without being in the server room.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

for the next report, I expect to open the ISCSI communication between the 
target and the initiators and create the VLAN and Trunk on the switch.

What is getting in your way?

I have to keep researching about ISCSI functionality to accomplish the objective
