 this is my first report. Today, as a team, we met with the client to obtain all the requirement
 he wants. we will be able to present the proposal according to the requirements in few days. also, for 
 our cloud project, I obtain some inforamtion of the ansible sowftware that will help us to have a base of 
 how works. I created a Repo where I will upload information and playbook.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

For the proposal, I hope to have enogh information about the hardware and software that will be use for the project
to include it in the proposal. In the Cloud project, I expect to finish the wiki in the repo with all information and 
reference I will need to install and configure ansible in my network environment

What is getting in your way?

Getting into an agreement of the proposal betwen the whole team migth be an issue. before it is presented
the all team should agree with the tools and software we are planning to use. also, the collaboration of each
participant will be complicated.
