What have you completed since the last report?

Today, I reconfigure the ISCSI. apparently there were some misconfiguration and the final set has been done through
the xen-center. I also reconfigure the trunk to get full access from the Cisco Lab. aparently the management conflicted with the external
VLAN and it could not reach the lab network

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I hope that this weekend jonnathan install successfully OSC and statr with the cloud project

What is getting in your way?

the requirements has been delivered. however, there are some researchs that have to be done.
