What have you completed since the last report?

We had struggles with the network. apparently, the Xen nodes are not accepting the 
NIC configuration. we had the idea that it is a lack of driver, but after a series of test,
we concluded that all drivers are correctly installed. 

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I hope we solve the problem with the network to install Open stack and move on with 
the rest of the configurations

What is getting in your way?

the network problem have taken most of the time and we are still analyzing the problem.
it is unidentified
