Status Report # 8
Date: 05/03/2018

What have you completed since the last report?

Due to a crash of the iscsi server, caused by me, I had to reinstalled the OS on the server and 
configure the target once again. the serve down was caused by a improperly mount of the hard disk partition.
After I recovered the server I reconfigure the initiator on the node 1 and it works properly

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

For the next report, I expect to have all node configure and be able to access the storage on the target. I also expect 
to start working on the network ( creating the subnets and configuring the VLANs)

What is getting in your way?

for now, nothing is getting on my way
