What have you completed since the last report?

Today, our client gave us more specifications about the project. I start installing centos 7

we can proceed to configure and install  xen in the compute blades

What is getting in your way?

the access to the server room s too restricted. I might have some troubles trying to have
access during my free time. however, I will try to do my best to be there as much as I can during the access hour
