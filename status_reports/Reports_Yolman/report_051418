What have you completed since the last report?

we hada a problem with the connection of the node to the network. VLANs were created,
but we haven't resolved the connectivity issues. Our supervisor came to help us. however,
most of the tests and troubleshooting wasn't successful.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I hope to give it another shot to the solution of the network issues. I plan to use a trunk link
to the only port that is functional. if it will not work; we might present another solution to our customer
using different software

What is getting in your way?

the  connectivity have become a real pain, and I am still thinking that there must be a problem
with the NIC
