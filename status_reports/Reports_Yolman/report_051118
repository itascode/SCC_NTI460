What have you completed since the last report?

We are not having traffic on the rest of the NICs on the nodes. We were not able to identified the
problem yet. We thought that it might be a hardware problem. however, we tested the NIC cards and they 
are working.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

There is a theory that I shared with my team. that the XenCenter is conflicting with the IOS of each node
and I might proceed to isolate each node and reinstall the IOS and configure them once again. I hope to have good 
result for the next report

What is getting in your way?

there is not to much information about our problem. however, I keep researching and I expect to have a entire
plan to proceed on monday.
