What have you completed since the last report?

I reconfigured the ISCSI target and install the initiators on the compute node 1.
I could mount the disk on the client. however, the node had a comflict with the disk.
it might have a bug somewhere. I also tried to establish the initiator on the node 2
but it couldn't connect with the target

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I expect to debug and solve the problems I had today with the iscsi and I hope  that the 
target and initiator work perfectly

What is getting in your way?

It will depend on the time a give to this task and there is not obstacle to work on it
