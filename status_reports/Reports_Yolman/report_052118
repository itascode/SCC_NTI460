What have you completed since the last report?

Today, I reconfigure the switch to have a better orientation of which port are connected to which box. I isolate the 
VLAN 80 because it will be our access to the outside and there are devices that will not be connected to it. until we figure 
put how to have internet connectivity or outside connection.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I am expecting to configure the VLAN 80 directly with the DNS on the server room to
obtain access to the outside

What is getting in your way?

I still waiting for some test on the stage of the Open Stack and recieve the requirements for the cloud project
