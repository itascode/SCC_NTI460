Status Report # 10
Date: 05/07/2018

What have you completed since the last report?

The Vlans are already set up, but the team is working on the intervlan configuration.
the servers are set on the vlan 80 until the whole network is established.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I hope to have the whole network set on the server. I will contribute to
configure and set the Vlans. we might use tagged VLANs

What is getting in your way?

I would like to do this job with the members in charge of this part of
the project to not lose track or destroy any job already done
