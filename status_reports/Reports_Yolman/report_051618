Status Report # 14

What have you completed since the last report?

Today, I successfully configure the nodes into the network. All VLAN are being trunked
from the switch to the port 0 of all nodes and XenServer. I also found out that the extra NIC
is not compatible to the verion 7.4 of Xen, so that they will not be used for those boxes with Xen installed

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

For the next report, I hope that my team starts to install the ansible and Open Stack on the controller. I also expect
that the target will be reconfigure to the parameters of the network.

What is getting in your way?

there is not obstacle now. So I hope my team will have all working together. I will be there to each process
to supervise and assist with any help.
