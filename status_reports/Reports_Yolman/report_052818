What have you completed since the last report?

the Open Stack installation has failed. we have have planned to install OSC with ansible (acording to jonnathan a little more complicated)
if this failed, we must install separately. I prepared some configuration to help my team.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

hopefully, we will install OSC and start testing it. I will also start with the cloud project creating an instance that will be
work as my localhost

What is getting in your way?

Due to the available time that my team and I have, we have decided to meet all together on Saturday to proceed with 
the installation also we will talk about the cloud project and how are we going to distribute the work. So next report we will generated on monday, 
June 2nd.
