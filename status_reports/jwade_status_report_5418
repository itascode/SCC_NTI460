Status Report # 8
Date: 5/4/2018

What have you completed since the last report?

I installed TeamViewer on the Win10 VM on the controller to give our team access to our project from the web. I downloaded the ssh keys from the server that were generated by the ansible-openstack script test to make sure we still have access to our project. I am doing reasearch on effective devops team management, including how to manage roles, assignments, and change management.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

We are meeting tomorrow morning to nail down our specific roles and assignments in the project. I plan to have a very specific plan of action for our implementation moving forward so we can stay on track and everyone gets to contribute and learn and we're not stepping all over one another. I hope to do more script testing tomorrow or Monday and start troubleshooting any errors.

What is getting in your way?

Time management. The team seems to be bickering a little. Also, I am feeling a little left out and not sure what's going on. I don't think everything is being documented. I think changes are being made and steps are being taken without the conssensus of the group. I really hope we can all get on the same page tomorrow.

On a side not, I apologize for missing Wednesday's status report. It was a busy day and I completely forgot. I will do my best to make sure it doesn't happen again.
