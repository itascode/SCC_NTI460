What have you completed since the last report?

Working on the automation scripts for ansible and openstack installs for our management server. Met with some of the team Tuesday evening to get updates on progress and develop a plan moving forward. Started installing VMs.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

Have a working script for the team to go over and make edits/addons, etc.

What is getting in your way?

Finding the time to be on-campus for working with the hardware. Network issues. I really hope we can get the networking up and create an outside management interface so we can work remotely.
