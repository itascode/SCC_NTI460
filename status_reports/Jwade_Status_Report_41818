What have you completed since the last report?

I have completed a rough draft for the SCC project proposal and posted it to slack for a team discussion on changes and add-ons.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I plan on doing research for software and hardware requirements for the SCC project, attending our team's lab session on Saturday to get started working in the hardware, and finalizing the installs and begin automating processes. Continue working on the proposal.

What is getting in your way?

There are some contraints on the times we are permitted to work in the lab and it seems a bit limited. I was hoping we would have more access and freedom to use the lab area. Other than that, I am feeling pretty good about our progress. I hope everything goes well on Saturday. :)
