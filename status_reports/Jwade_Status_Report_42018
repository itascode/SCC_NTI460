Status Report # 3
Date: 4/20/2018

What have you completed since the last report?

I have finalized the SCC DevOps Project proposal based on team member suggested edits and created a GitHub repo with the proposal in markdown. I made all team members collaborators in the repo. I have also continued researching installation and use of the software requirements for use in the lab.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I will attend the class lab session Saturday morning and begin working on the hardware for software installations and finalizing the implementation of our project. I will also work on class assignments due for Monday. Continue reasearch on openstack and yaml playbooks for installation.

What is getting in your way?

Access to the lab. Need a clearer understanding of the hardware and software to be used in the lab. I am a little worried the scope of this project might be too large as some of the hardware and most of the software are all new to me and require a lot of research. I think  there will be a lot of trial and error. I hope everyting will be more clear after our lab session on Saturday.
