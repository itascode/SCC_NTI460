What have you completed since the last report?

This is my first status report. I have installed ansible. Read the documentation. Written and executed a playbook to spin up an AWS ec2 instance for use as a webserver and another playbook to remotely install apache on the webserver.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

Work on assignnemnts and tasks as assigned in team meeting on Monday evening. Create a list of software requirements, rough draft of project proposal, and diagram/documentation for physical/network hardware.

What is getting in your way?

Nothing, yet. I feel like so far I am on track. :)
