Status Report # 9
Date: 5/9/2018

What have you completed since the last report?

I have been working with the team to complete the setup of our networking requirements. Also, I have continued testing the openstack-ansible install scripts on GCloud.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I hope to begin testing the scripts on the on-premise hardware after networking is set up. Definitely by Saturday's meetup, is not before.

What is getting in your way?

Balancing work, school, and life. It's always a challenge.
