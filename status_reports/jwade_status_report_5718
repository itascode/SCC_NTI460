What have you completed since the last report?

I attended the meeting on Saturday where we nailed down our roles on the project and a game plan moving forward. I built a small network in gcloud to start testing the ansible-openstack install while the team gets networking finalized and up an running.

What do you plan to complete by the next report?

I hope to be testing on the on-premise hardware by Wednesday afternoon.

What is getting in your way?

Just trying to figure out how to take the big install in the ansible-openstack docs and make it simpler for our small network/environment.
