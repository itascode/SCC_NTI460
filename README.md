## **TEXTBOOK:**

There are no required textbooks for this course. The software we will be using, and its documentation are available on the web.

## **ABOUT THE COURSE:**

In this course students work in teams to create a DevOps project. Students store and share code via GitHub and utilize small team agile strategies. Students write requirements documents, build out project requirements, and integrate components into a larger group project.

This course is structured as an off­site lab course. The students will be divided into small teams to complete the development of a DevOps project for a third­-party "customer". The class meetings times will be used primarily for contact with the customer. The student teams are expected to arrange other times to meet to plan and work on the project.

The primary focus of this course is the application of the material you learned in the associated development course, as well as information you have learned about enterprise networking, DevOps and architecture.

The course overview in Canvas gives the projects we’ll develop for this course.

## **CLASSROOM DIVERSITY STATEMENT:**

Respect for diversity is a core value of SCC. Our college community fosters an optimal learning climate and an environment of mutual respect. We, the college community, recognize individual differences. Therefore, we are responsible for the content and tone of our statements and are empathetic speakers and listeners.

## **DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION:**

Students with documented disabilities requesting class accommodations, requiring special arrangements in case of building evacuation, or have emergency medical information the instructor should know about are asked to contact the disability support services office (DSS) in Rm. 1112. Once the disability is verified with DSS you will be given a letter of accommodation that should be handed to your instructor

## **PRACTICUM PROJECT:**

Unlike most of your other classes, the primary source for your grade for the course will be a single project assigned to small development teams. While the bulk of the project evaluation will be based on functionality and will be awarded corporately to the team, there will also be individual evaluation vehicles.

The project will be divided into stages. For each of these stages there will be a group deliverable and some individual deliverables. Each non-final stage’s deliverables will be detailed in Canvas as the course progresses.

In the final stage, the delivery will include the final component reports, as well as reporting on the integration phase. The primary evaluation metric for the final delivery is how well the common requirements have been met by the delivered system.

The group report for the final delivery shall outline the problems and triumphs encountered during the work on the project. It should describe the features of the practicum project that are not working to specification and some indication of what would be required to make them work.

The final delivery will include a short group presentation of the work, about 30 minutes per group. It may include a demonstration of the system, particularly if there are some additional features that were implemented that you would like to "show off". The presentation shall involve each group member

## **INDIVIDUAL DELIVERABLES:**

Each stage of the project has individual deliverables as well. They do not vary based on the stage of the project. They are: personal reflection and peer evaluation.

The personal reflection is a document outlining what you have individually learned during the current stage. The purpose of the reflection paper is to help concretize the lessons learned. By forcing you to commit those ideas to paper, it makes that more "real" to you, something that you'll be more able to apply later. The reflection does not need to be long. A couple of well written paragraphs may capture things well. Of course, if you need more space, that's fine too.

The peer evaluation is also quite short. It is essentially a standard form that each student completes, outlining the work done by each group member during the current stage of the project and the valuation of that work to accomplishing the goals for the stage.

## **GRADING POLICY (MAY BE ADJUSTED):**

Each graded task you perform is worth a certain number of points. These points will be converted to normalized points. All normalized points are equal.

Grade awarded will be mapped to the total number of normalized points earned as follows (instructor reserves the right to adjust this scale):

 - Intermediate Phases (=‘Daily’ Status Report*) | 30%
 - Final Delivery | 20%
 - Final Presentation | 5%
 - Individual Reports (4 X 5%) | 20%
 - Peer Reviews (4 X 5%) | 20%
 - Attendances (Scheduled meetings) | 5%

After the weighted average of the points is calculated, the following table shows the correspondence of scores to grade for the course: (The instructor reserves the right to adjust this scale.)

* ‘Daily’ Status Report: each individual need to create three status reports each week. The status reports are due on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The first report is due to 04/23/2018.

**Check in your report to your Github repository. I’ll check the reports and the timestamp of the reports for grading.**

Each report includes:

 - What have you completed since the last report?
   
 - What do you plan to complete by the next report?

 - What is getting in your way?

## **GRADING SCALE**

 - 4.0 | 95% and up
 - 3.0 | 83%
 - 2.0 | 72%
